# Generative Art

I've always been fascinated by generative art, aka procedural art.  Generative art is art that in whole or in part is created algorithmically.  My earliest efforts were on my first computer, an Apple ][+.  Things really got started once I got a PC and wrote my ray tracer, Vivid.  Here's the first image I publicly shared from Vivid:

Ray traced images are known for their accurate calculation of shadow, reflection, and refraction.

> Historical aside: Vivid was instrumental in my meeting Lili.  When I wrote Vivid, I was working at Boeing.  I had been reading a lot about graphics and wanted a testbed to experiment with some ideas.  This led to writing Vivid.  After getting some positive feedback showing off the images on local BBSs and CompuServe (yes, before the web ruled the earth) I decided to release Vivid as a shareware product.  Much polishing and documenting later and it was released.  One day I received a call from a guy who liked Vivid and wanted to talk about collaborating in some way.  He had previously co-authored some computer graphics books which I had actually read.  They weren't that good. I told him what I thought and he agreed and asked if I could do better.  Two weeks later he called back and said that we had an contract offer from M&T Publishing to do a book on ray tracing.  A year later I was a published author. <br><br> Back in the day, Tower Books in downtown Bellevue had the best computer science section in the state.  You want SIGGRAPH Proceedings from 7 years ago?  Yep, they had it.  Before Amazon, this was the only place to go.  One evening, my cubicle mate form Boeing was hanging out at Tower and noticed a guy buying every graphics book he could find.  He struck up a conversation and recommended my book.  Sadly(?), the book was currently sold out so the guy buying the books gave my co-worker his card to pass on to me.  "Have Stephen give me a call."  The man turned out to be David Norris, a long time Microsoftie who was putting together a graphics group.  We chatted on the phone, which led to an informational interview, a real interview, and a job offer. <br><br> The org I hired into was called Advanced Computer Technology and had a diverse set of groups working within it.  One thing common to all was that they were growing rapidly.  At one point I was asked to do an interview for a sibling team which was looking for a developer that had good graphics knowledge.  The manager of the team, Linda Stone, liked my interview feedback.  She felt like I grokked what kind of person she was looking for so I became a regular fixture on her interview loops.  At the time, Lili worked on her team and this was how we met.  It would be another dozen years or so before we actually worked together.  And yes, that story also involves software I wrote just for fun.

In addition to generative art I'm also a fan of woodblock prints.  At one point I decided to try and copy the typical style of woodblock shading with code.  Here's an example print showing what I was trying to achieve:
